# Community driven Python repository

This is where you (dev) can puplish your extensions and also where you (user) can find a bunch of nifty workflows.

Note that this repo is not necessarily peer reviewed.

Further there are some technical aspects of this repo. GitHub packs _all_ PRs into the repos refspecs, which lead to an explosion in size of the official python repo. This repo tries to avoid this kind of problems.
